You can place any number of projects into a workspace.

Projects are combinations of modules, folders, and files. Projects can be mapped 1:1 to a source code repository. If a project is given a type, then Che will active plug-ins related to that type. For example, projects with the maven project type will automatically get the Java plug-in, which provides a variety of intellisense for Java projects.
