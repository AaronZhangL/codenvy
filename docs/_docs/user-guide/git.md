Codenvy is built on Eclipse Che which supports Git and Subversion. Both git and SVN are installed in our ready-to-go images. Git and SVN functionality is available in the IDE (`Git` or `Subversion` menus) and in the terminal. When using the menus, commands are injected into your environment and output is streamed into a `Git` or `SVN` console panel.
