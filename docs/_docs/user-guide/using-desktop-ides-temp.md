# Standard SSH Connection  
It's possible to establish SSH connection between your desktop IDE and a remote Codenvy workspace.

In Codenvy create a new workspace, open it in the IDE and import any project in there. On the Consoles panel click `Connect via SSH`, you will see the following instructions: 
```shell  
You can connect your SSH client to 'default' with:

[LINUX | OSX]
ssh user@${hostname} -p ${port} [-i /path/to/your/private/ssh/key]

[WINDOWS]
putty -ssh -l user -P ${port} ${hostname} [-i /path/to/your/private/ssh/key]

USERNAME: user
PASSWORD: secret

NOTES:
1. You can login with user / password, but it is not recommended.
2. Use an SSH key pair to securely authenticate.
3. You can generate new SSH key pairs at `Profile -> Preferences -> SSH -> Machine`
4. Or, you can upload your own public key.
5. You must restart your workspace for the keys to take affect.
6. You can verify your key by opening a terminal and viewing `/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys`

WINDOWS USERS:
1. Download Putty and add it to your %PATH% environment.
2. Use PuttyGen to convert SSH keys generated by Che to putty PPK files.
3. Use the Putty .ppk file as the key reference.\
```
Follow the below steps to connect to a remote Codenvy workspace from the local IDE on Linux:

1. When in the Codenvy IDE, go to `Profile > Preferences > Machine > SSH` and upload your local **public** key there. Restart a workspace.

2. Open your local Terminal and execute `sshfs user@${hostname}:/projects /your/local/directory/ -p ${port}`, where ${port} is a random port from the ephemeral port range, to which 22 port is mapped (you can find it on the Consoles panel > SSH or at the Operations Perspective > Servers tab). This command will mount `/projects` folder to your local directory. 

3. Check the local directory to verify if your Codenvy projects are there.
   
4. Open your favorite local IDE and import your Codenvy project. 

5. Make some edits in the project. 

6. Go to a Codenvy workspace to verify changes are there.

# Unison/Fuse Mount  
Codenvy suggests that Windows, Linux, and Mac users all use sshfs to directly mount mount folders from the workspace to the local desktop computer. See above section [Standard SSH Connection](https://codenvy.readme.io/docs/using-desktop-ides#standard-ssh-connection) for additional information. Codenvy users on Windows can use sshfs by installing free software [win-sshfs](https://code.google.com/archive/p/win-sshfs/) for Window versions up to 7 or by purchasing software such as [SFTP Net Drive](https://www.eldos.com/) for Windows 8.0, 8.1 or 10.

Codenvy has developed Eclipse Che's fuse-based mount and sync mechanism that can be used as an alternative if sshfs is not preferred by the Codenvy user. This is delivered as a Docker container that combines `sshfs` with `unison`. You can perform a mount on any operating system that supports Docker. However, if you are on Windows using Boot2Docker, then you can only mount directories in `%userprofile%`.
#### Experimental
This method is designed to create a connection between Codenvy and the host filesystem but it is currently experimental. Please provide feedback through GitHub issues at https://github.com/codenvy/codenvy/issues.  

In the IDE, open the “Consoles” panel and press “SSH”. Here you will find information you will need:
- The default user name / password
- The IP of the codenvy server = `<codenvy-server-ip>` in the Docker command below
- The ephemeral port for SSH = `<codenvy-server-ssh-port>` in the Docker command below

Capture all three of these items.

Using Docker launch the `che-mount` container, passing in the information you captured from the SSH screen:
```shell  
# Launch the Che mount container with your Codenvy instance
docker run --rm -it \
					 --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
           --device /dev/fuse \
           --name codenvy-mount \
           -v /c/Users/%USERNAME%/mount:/mnthost \
           codenvy/che-mount <codenvy-server-ip> <codenvy-server-ssh-port>\
```
Once started the container will ask for the username and password.
